## OBJECTIVES
* Familiarize yourself with Github and basic git

* Familiarize yourself with the JupyterLab environment, Markdown and Python

* Explore JupyterHub Linux console integrating what you learned in the prior parts of this homework

* Perform basic data engineering in Python using Chocolate Review Data

## WHAT TO TURN IN
You are being encouraged to turn the assignment in using the provided
Jupyter Notebook.  To do so, make a directory in your Lab environment called
`homework/hw0`.   Put all of your files in that directory.  Then zip or tar that directory,
rename it with your name as the first part of the filename (e.g. `maull_hw0_files.zip`, `maull_hw0_files.tar.gz`), then
download it to your local machine, then upload the `.zip` to Blackboard.

If you do not know how to do this, please ask, or visit one of the many tutorials out there
on the basics of using zip in Linux.

If you choose not to use the provided notebook, you will still need to turn in a
`.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and corresponding files according to the instructions in
this homework.


## ASSIGNMENT TASKS
### (0%) Familiarize yourself with Github and basic git 

[Github (https://github.com)](https://github.com) is the _de facto_ platform for open source software in the world based
on the very popular [git (https://git-scm.org)](https://git-scm.org) version control system. Git has a sophisticated set
of tools for version control based on the concept of local repositories for fast commits and remote
repositories only when collaboration and remote synchronization is necessary.  Github enhances git by providing
tools and online hosting of public and private repositories to encourage and promote sharing and collaboration.
Github hosts some of the world's most widely used open source software.

**If you are already familiar with git and Github, then this part will be very easy!**

**&#167; Task:**  **Create a Zotero account.**

Learn about Zotero and if you haven't already, create a free account:

* [https://zotero.org](https://zotero.org)


**&#167; Task:**  **Create a public Github repo named `"mcis6273-s25-datamining"` and place a `README.md` file in it.**

Create your first file called
`README.md` at the top level of the repository.  

Please put your Zotero username in the file. Aside from that you can put whatever text you like in the file 
(If you like, use something like [lorem ipsum](https://lipsum.com/)
to generate random sentences to place in the file.).
Please include the link to **your** Github repository that now includes the minimal `README.md`. 
You don't have to have anything elaborate in that file or the repo. 


**&#167; Task:**  **Fork the course repository.**

Learn to use Github workflows and fork the class repo:

* [https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_s25_datamining/](https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_s25_datamining/)



### (0%) Familiarize yourself with the JupyterLab environment, Markdown and Python 

As stated in the course announcement [Jupyter (https://jupyter.org)](https://jupyter.org) is the
core platform we will be using in this course and
is a popular platform for data scientists around the world.  We have a JupyterLab
setup for this course so that we can operate in a cloud-hosted environment, free from
some of the resource constraints of running Jupyter on your local machine (though you are free to set
it up on your own and seek my advice if you desire).

You have been given the information about the  Jupyter environment we have setup for our course, and
the underlying Python environment will be using is the [Anaconda (https://anaconda.com)](https://anaconda.com)
distribution.  It is not necessary for this assignment, but you are free to look at the multitude
of packages installed with Anaconda, though we will not use the majority of them explicitly.

As you will soon find out, Notebooks are an incredibly effective way to mix code with narrative
and you can create cells that are entirely code or entirely Markdown.  Markdown (MD or `md`) is
a highly readable text format that allows for easy documentation of text files, while allowing
for HTML-based rendering of the text in a way that is style-independent.

We will be using Markdown frequently in this course, and you will learn that there are many different
"flavors" or Markdown.  We will only be using the basic flavor, but you will benefit from exploring
the "Github flavored" Markdown, though you will not be responsible for using it in this course -- only the
"basic" flavor.  Please refer to the original course announcement about Markdown.

**&#167; Task:**  **THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS PART.** 

Play with and become familiar with the basic functions of
the Lab environment given to you online in the course Blackboard.


**&#167; Task:**  **THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS PART.** 

Please _create a markdown document_ and
read the documentation for basic Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). 
Learn to use all of the following:

* headings (one level is fine),
* bullets,
* bold and italics

Again, the content of your documentcan be whatever you like, just learn some
of the basic functionality of Markdown.  



### (0%) Explore JupyterHub Linux console integrating what you learned in the prior parts of this homework 

The Linux console in JupyterLab is a great way to perform command-line tasks and is an essential tool
for basic scripting that is part of a data scientist's toolkit.  Open a console in the lab environment
and familiarize yourself with your files and basic commands using git as indicated below.

1. In a new JupyterLab command line console, run the `git clone` command to clone the new
  repository you created in the prior part.
  You will want to read the documentation on this 
  command (try here [https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) to get a good
  start).
2. Within the same console, modify your `README.md` file, check it in and push it back to your repository, using
  `git push`.  Read the [documentation about `git push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push).
3. The commands `wget` and `curl` are useful for grabbing data and files from remote resources off the web.
  Read the documentation on each of these commands by typing `man wget` or `man curl` in the terminal.
  Make sure you pipe the output to a file or use the proper flags to do so.

**&#167; Task:**  **THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS PART.**



### (100%) Perform basic data engineering in Python using Chocolate Review Data 

We have learned that data engineering is an
important task and ultimately the _initial_
process which most data mining begins.

In this assignment you will get you hands
with _real_ data that have relevant and practical application.

As you may different feelings about it, 
but _many_ humans love chocolate.  I am
personally a dark chocolate, lover --
70% cacoa or greater, thank you.  But
I cannot call myself a chocolate Connoisseur,
though maybe one day I'll have enough time
and money to be one.  But there are indeed
true connoisseurs and there is even an
interesting site out there dedicated to it:

* [https://flavorsofcacao.com/](https://flavorsofcacao.com/)


On this site, you might learn a lot about chocolate
tasting, evaluation and even another group's evaluation
of chocolate from around the world -- and the source
of our data for this part of the assignment.

You will notice there is a "database" of over 2800
plain dark chocolate bars that have been reviewed
over several years.  These bars hail from all
over the world and are subjectively rated, though
it is unclear who actually did the rating.

In any event, while it is called a database, to you 
and I it is a big Javascript table.  I have
made it easier for the assignment by
including that file on Github here:


* [https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_s25_datamining/blob/main/hw0/data/2024_flavors_of_cacoa.tsv](https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_s25_datamining/blob/main/hw0/data/2024_flavors_of_cacoa.tsv)

_Data engineering_ as you have learned from the readings
is about transforming data from one form to another so
that it can be used in the appropriate analysis 
contexts.

In this part of the homework you will prepare data for 
analysis.  This dataset is rather small, but it is
a great warmup set for introductory data engineering
and usage of Pandas.

Your code must be implemented in Jupyter as a notebook and you
will be required to turn in a `.ipynb` file.

**&#167; Task:**  **Use Python/Pandas to load, transform and store a CSV file.**
  
A lot of times we would like to clean up data in 
a file.  In this case, we have a lot of it, and the
reality is that we only need _some_ of the data
in the file.

You will first need to grab the `.tsv` listed above
into your Jupyter environment. 

You will need to  place that file into a folder called
`data` and then 
load the CSV into a DataFrame
using the following code:

```python
  df = pd.read_csv( "./data/2024_flavors_of_cacoa.csv", sep='\t')
```

There is a starter notebook on Github with the first cells
running these steps for you.  See:

* [https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_f25_datamining/hw0/hw0_starter_nb.ipynb](https://github.com/kmsaumcis/mcis6273_f25_datamining/hw0/hw0_starter_nb.ipynb)

When you inspect the  DataFrame 
you will notice that some of the data will
need transformation and must do so 
using Pandas: [https://pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org).  


**DATA TRANSFORMATION**

There are three things
we are going to do to the data:

1. We are going to transform the `"Cacao Percent"` column to
   a floating between 0 and 1, so that the original
   string `"76%"` is tranformed to the number `0.76`.  Later
   this will facilitate machine learning algorithms.
2. We are going to split the `"Ingredients"` column 
   into multiple columns.  You will notice that
   the column currently might look something like
   `"3- B,S,C"`.  This means there are `3`
   ingredients, `"B"`, `"S"` and `"C"`.  Above the 
   table on the site is a description of what these are.
   You will need the following tools: `DataFrame.apply()`,
   `Series.str.split()` and `Series.str.strip()`.  Once
   your munging is done, make sure the column type is
   set to `int` using `pd.astype()` and that
   the resulting columns are merged into the main 
   DataFrame. _This step should
   add 8 new columns to your DataFrame: `"B", "C","L","S","S*","Sa","V"`
   and `"ingredient_count"`_.
3. We are going to split out the `"Most Memorable Characteristics"`
   into **all** of the characterstics listed which 
   occur **20 or more times**.  To do this, you 
   may need to study `Series.str.get_dummies()`.  You might
   also find the `Series.agg("sum")`, `Series.sort_values()`, `Series.where()` or `DataFrame.query()`
   of great use.  There are other ways to 
   accomplish the goal, but these are 
   accessible and easily implemented in one or two lines.  You will end up 
   with 71 new columns.

**DATA FINALIZATION**

To finalize your data, you will need to drop the `"Ingredients"` and `"Most
Memorable Characteristics"` columns.  They are no longer needed (steps 2 and
3 above solved that problem for us).  

Your final DataFrame should have 86 total columns.


**MINIMUM EXPECTATIONS IN THE ANSWER FOR THIS TASK PART**

Your answer must include:

* the cleaned files need to go into a `'data/'` folder (created by you)
* the first row of your newly exported CSV file must include ALL the headers of ALL columns
* all the data rows should have data and nothing else (e.g. 
  there should be no rows with headers or junk data, etc.)
* your new cleaned output file should be called `'data/cleaned_data_2025_flavors_of_cacao.csv'`


**&#167; Task:**  **Extract, transform and export JSON data.**

Now that you have a CSV file, we will transform and deploy it
to CSV and now JSON. The file needs to have the following 
characteristics:

* the columns will be restricted to 4 columns, `Review Date`, `Country of Bean Origin`, `Cacao Percent` and `Rating`
* store the finalized data set in two files (use `Pandas.to_csv()` and `Pandas.to_json()`):
  * a CSV file `'data/data_reduced_2025_flavors_of_cacao.csv'`
  * a JSON file `'data/data_reduced_2025_flavors_of_cacao.csv'`


**&#167; Task:**  **Filter, transform and export CSV data.**

You will now loop over all the data to produce a filtered
file  with the following:

*  _at or above_ rating 3.25, 
*  a cacao percent between 65 and 75, 
* reviewed between 2018 and 2021
* and have "fatty", "earthy" or "roasty" characteristics.

Reduce the data to only those rows with a filters provided
and store it in a file.  Use the enriched DataFrame you produced
from the first part, NOT the source original file.

You must store the data table in CSV and JSON files called `'data/data_filtered_2025_flavors_of_cacao.csv'` 
and `'data/data_filtered_2025_flavors_of_cacao.json'` in the `'data/'` folder 


**&#167; Task:**  **Complete the online HW0 assessment.**

Once you are done with the coding part of the assignment, you will need to complete the online assessment for
the final 6 points of your grade.
